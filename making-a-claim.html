              <p>
                Should you wish to make a claim against your employer, you are required to lodge an ET1 form at the Employment Tribunal. This is a document which sets out your claim. It is important that this document is drafted correctly in order for your claim to be accepted by the Employment Tribunal and due to the fact that it will be referred to throughout Court Proceedings. If not properly drafted it could impact on the outcome of the proceedings and the amount of compensation which you are awarded even if successful.
              </p>
              <p>
                Time limitations are very important in Employment claims and must strictly be adhered to. The majority of employment claims must be presented at the Tribunal within three months. It is important that you seek advise as to the date from which the three month period runs. For example in dismissal cases the time limitation would be three months from the date of dismissal. If your matter relates to discrimination you must make a claim within three months of the act that you are complaining of. It is therefore essential that you seek legal advice as soon as possible to ensure that you do not miss your deadline.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once your ET1 form is lodged at the Tribunal, your employer will be provided with a copy and will have 28 days to respond. Your matter will then be listed for a hearing at the relevant Tribunal.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Tribunal will require you and your employer to file witness statements as evidence to your case and you will also need to provide a schedule of loss. You are also required to exchange any evidence you wish to rely upon in your claim. We can advise you of the type of evidence that is needed to prove your case and the losses for which you may be entitled to make a claim for compensation. This will take the stress away from you and we will progress your case as efficiently and as cost effectively as possible.

                We are able to arrange for you to be represented in the Tribunal. If possible we will try to negotiate a settlement prior to the hearing or even at the hearing itself to save you costs or to avoid an undesirable outcome should your employer's evidence be weighed against you.
              </p>

                We will work to ensure we get the best result for you. Our rates are very competitive and we try to keep costs as low as possible.
