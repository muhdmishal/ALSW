              <p>
                Speeding offences were first introduced to protect drivers, passengers and other road users from death or injury. Although this remains the underlying purpose, more recent trends suggest that financial considerations may also have a bearing on the current much harsher level of enforcement and detection.
              </p>
              <p>
                Speed detection devices are now much more sophisticated and speed restrictions are more varied and unpredictable which has resulted in a greater number of prosecutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                A conviction may result in penalty points and a fine or disqualification depending upon the speed you were travelling. This may therefore have serious implications for those who already have penalty points on their licence or who face disqualification under the "totting up" provisions particularly if their job depends upon them being able to drive.
              </p>
              <p>
                Depending upon the type of device used there are certain procedural guidelines which should be followed. If these guidelines are not followed then we could assist you by challenging the charge so that the allegation is dropped.
              </p>
              <p>
                If we are not able to do this we can arrange for representation at court if you are at risk of disqualification to help you avoid a ban altogether or to ensure that the ban is kept to a minimum.
              </p>
              <p>
                Please call us on 020 8301 4884 or email us on enquiries@alettashaw.co.uk and we will advise you whether we can assist you with your case.
