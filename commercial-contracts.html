              <p>
                Well drafted and properly executed contractual documents are vital for a business to operate effectively. Poorly drafted legal documents, or the absence of documents, can lead to unnecessary risks and costly disputes which can be damaging to a business’s reputation. Parties can be reluctant to negotiate sensitive terms for fear of harming a fruitful business relationship. Instructing solicitors can help achieve a favourable arm’s length deal while preserving internal and external business relationships for clients.
              </p>
              <p>
                Often businesses and individuals are presented with pre-drafted terms and conditions (by a supplier or financier for example) which can be unfairly one sided. Instructing solicitors can help identify and remove onerous terms resulting in a more balanced agreement. We can review standard documents or draft from scratch for a one off fixed fee.
