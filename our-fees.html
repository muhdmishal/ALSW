              <h2>Fixed Fees (one time payment arrangement)</h2>
              <p>
                No hidden extras.
              </p>
              <p>
                On some occasions we can offer fixed fees on the following matters:
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>Initial consultation</li>
                <li>Divorce</li>
                <li>Representation at Court</li>
                <li>Motoring Offences</li>
                <li>Conveyancing</li>
                <li>Wills</li>
                <li>Probate</li>
                <li>Powers of Attorney</li>
                <li>Change of name</li>
                <li>Drafting a specific document</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
              Please contact us to find out if your matter is suitable for a one time payment arrangement.
              </p>
              <h2>Hourly Rate</h2>
              <p>
                On more complex and specialist matters we usually charge on an hourly rate which varies depending on how senior the person is who is carrying out the work.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will be open and clear about our costs and will ensure that they are kept to a minimum. We will do this by:
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>Giving you regular costs advice in advance of incurring costs</li>
                <li>Agreeing payment plans with you</li>
                <li>Invoicing on a monthly basis so that you can budget</li>
                <li>Offering a facility for payment by credit or debit card</li>
              </ul>
              <h2>How you can help keep your costs down</h2>
              <p>
                We charge for the work we do according to the length of time we spend on your matter including telephone calls, emails, preparing documents and writing letters. Frequent, lengthy and unnecessary telephone calls or meetings with your solicitor will result in further costs to you. Therefore keep your calls to a minimum.
              </p>
              <p>
                The clearer your instructions are, the quicker we can prepare your applications and statements and the less we will charge you. So, before you make a telephone call or come for a consultation, make a list of everything you need to let us know.
              </p>
              <h2>Free Legal Advice</h2>
              <p>
