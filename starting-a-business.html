              <h1>Starting a Business</h1>
              <p>
                Starting a new business can be both a daunting and exciting time. It is important that your new company is structured to suit your business needs and not a generic “off the shelf�? model that will need changing at a later date. We have experience in a range of different start-ups including internet based companies, high street retailers, the hospitality sector, media companies and multi-nationals. Our team will ensure your new company complies with all legal formalities as amended from time to time.
