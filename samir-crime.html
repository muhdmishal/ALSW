              <h2>Criminal Solicitor</h2>
              <p>
                Samir has represented clients in complex and high profile cases which he deals with sensitively and by clearly advising his clients without the use of legal jargon.
              </p>

			  <p>
			  The reason that he achieves so many successful outcomes is because he is non-judgemental, thorough, tactically astute and proactive.
			  </p>

			  <p>
			  Samir recently successfully represented a client in a high profile case relating to use of social media namely Twitter, which encompassed ground breaking issues of freedom of speech in this relatively young area of criminal law and which was widely reported in national newspapers.
			  </p>

			  <p>
			  Samir also represented two clients in a multi defendant high profile fraud case in which both of his clients were acquitted in a case in which a number of the remaining Defendants received custodial sentences.
			  </p>

				<p>
				He has an excellent track record in both defending and offering mitigation on behalf of his clients so that they receive the minimum sentence or an acquittal.
				</p>


              <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
              <p>
