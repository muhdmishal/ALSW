              <h1 class="page-title">The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill</h1>
              <h3>Date Written: 06.02.2014</h3>
              <p>
                The Criminal Justice and Courts Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 5th February 2014 and is expected to receive Royal Assent by the end of the year. It proposes sentencing reforms which are aimed at making sure offenders are punished properly and consistently and at the same time reducing the cost to the tax payer.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bill will introduce a number of new offences.
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>An offence of being unlawfully at large, </li>
                <li>An offence of possession of extreme pornography that shows images depicting rape</li>
                <li>Four specific offences of juror misconduct are aimed at reducing the risk of trials being abandoned and the consequential costs burden, to include an offence of researching information relevant to the case, intentionally passing information to another juror that he/she has researched about the case, intentionally disclosing information about votes cast by jury members, statements made, opinions and arguments advanced whilst deliberating upon the proceedings.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                There will be a clampdown on cautions for repeat offenders and for serious offences such as rape, possession of an offensive weapon, supplying class A drugs or sexual offences against children and a hardline approach to sentencing paedophiles and terrorists.
              </p>
              <p>
                Automatic early release for terrorists and child rapists is to be scrapped and offenders receiving extended determinate sentence will no longer be released automatically two-thirds of the way through their custodial term, but will be released at the discretion of the Parole Board.
              </p>
              <p>
                There will be maximum sentences for three terrorist offences - weapons training for terrorist purposes, other training for terrorism and making or possession of explosives which will be increased to a life sentence. Those convicted of a second very serious offence will face an automatic life sentence.
              </p>
              <p>
                Single magistrates, rather than a bench of two or three, will be able to deal with less serious cases outside the courtroom, supported by a legal adviser and there is to be the introduction of ‘secure colleges’ which will put education at the forefront of rehabilitation for young offenders.
              </p>
              <p>
                A change to the maximum age at which people can serve on a jury from 70 to 75 is also proposed.
              </p>
              <p>
                Offenders will make a contribution to the costs of running the court system.  The Criminal Cost Charge will result in a charge being made to convicted offender, based on the costs of their case and not on the sentence.  Offenders under the age of 18 will not have to pay the Criminal Cost Charge.
