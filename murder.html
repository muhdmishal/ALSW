              <h1>Murder/Manslaughter/Attempted Murder</h1>
              <h2>Murder</h2>
              <p>
                The offence of murder is committed if a person of sound mind unlawfully kills another, with the intention to either kill or cause grievous bodily harm or where they are negligent or reckless as to whether harm would be caused.
              </p>
              <p>
                The offence is always tried in a Crown Court before a judge and jury and if convicted there is a mandatory life sentence for a person over 18 years of age.
              </p>
              <h2>Manslaughter</h2>
              <p>
                Voluntary manslaughter occurs where all elements of murder are present, but there was provocation or diminished responsibility. Involuntary manslaughter occurs where a person unlawfully kills another but did not intend to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.
              </p>
              <h2>Attempted Murder</h2>
              <p>
                The offence is committed if there is an intention to kill another and that something “more than merely preparatory�? was done to cause the death. In a case of attempted murder, there must have been an intention to kill, but, unlike murder the offence is not committed if there was an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. The degree of harm actually caused will be taken into account when sentencing.

              <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
              <p>
                Many firms of solicitors dealing with criminal cases instruct in-house solicitor advocates, often with limited experience. At Aletta Shaw we always instruct specialist barristers from highly reputable criminal chambers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are able to achieve outstanding results by taking time to understand the circumstances of your case, by making an in depth analysis of the evidence that the prosecution are relying on and by arranging quality expert witnesses to help with the presentation of forensic and medical evidence where appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will always keep you up to date with developments in your case and help you understand the legal issues as they arise throughout.
