              <h1>Contracts of Employment</h1>
              <p>
                Your Employer has a duty to provide a written statement of particulars of employment which contains basic information for you such as your salary, dates of employment and your job title. Before signing a contract, it is important to seek legal advice to ensure that the agreement you sign is in the best possible terms for you.
              </p>
              <h2>Pre Employment</h2>
              <p>
                Within many contracts there may be clauses relating to restrictive covenants. These are terms which stop you from doing something after you have left your employment. The most common restrictive covenant is one which limits your ability to work for any rival companies. Your employer will often have a clause limiting your ability to do so, for example, insisting that you can not work for any rival companies.
              </p>
              <h2>During Employment</h2>
              <p>
                If you feel your employer has breached your contact we can advise you on the merits of your case. If we are of the view you have a claim, we can prepare the paperwork required to make the relevant application and arrange representation for you at Court for a reasonable fee.
              </p>
              <h2>Terminating Employment</h2>
              <p>
                If you are currently in employment and are being restricted by your employer from moving on to another company, then we can review your contract of employment for you and advise you as to the risks and merits of your case.
              </p>
