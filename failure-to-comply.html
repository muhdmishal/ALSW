              <h1 class="page-title">Failing To Comply With Road Signs And Other Signals</h1>
              <p>
                If charged with failing to comply with road signs or other signals you could be given a fine of up to £1,000 and either 3 penalty points or a disqualification in certain circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
                It will be particularly important for you to have legal representation if there is a risk that you could lose your licence either through <a href="totting.html">"totting up"</a> or where the Magistrates use their discretion to impose a ban.</p>
              <p>
                There are a number of defences to this charge, such as, where the failure to comply resulted due to mechanical defect, where detection devices or other equipment involved are incorrectly calibrated or operated or where road signs do not conform to the relevant traffic regulations.
