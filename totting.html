              <h1>Totting Up Of Penalty Points</h1>
              <p>
                If, in a 3 year period you accumulate 12 points or more on your driving licence you will usually be subject to a driving ban lasting a minimum of 6 months under the "totting up" provisions. The 3 year period relates to the period when the offences were committed not when the points are awarded.
              </p>
              <p>
                If there are mitigating factors the court has discretion not to impose a ban if you are likely to suffer excessive hardship. Such circumstances would be, for example, where you would be at risk of losing your job or if you have a disability and you depend upon your car to maintain mobility.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will be able to assist you by advising you whether there are any mitigating factors which may persuade the Magistrates not to impose a ban or to keep any period of disqualification to a minimum. We can also arrange for you to be represented at any court hearings to make representations for you. You are more likely to have a successful outcome if the facts are clearly and persuasively presented by an experienced advocate at a hearing.
