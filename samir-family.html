              <h2>Solicitor Family Team</h2>
              <p>
                Samir is always able to put clients at ease with his approachable manner. He focuses quickly on the important issues of the case and gives clear practical advice. As a result his cases are often concluded quickly and cost effectively, whilst achieving the clientâ€™s aims and objectives.
              </p>

			  <p>
			  Samir is a member of Resolution and regularly represents clients in the County and Family Proceedings Court where he conducts advocacy. Even the most nervous clients are reassured by his confident and positive attitude. At court Samir is often able to settle matters by negotiation, but where that is not possible clients know that Samir will effectively present their case before the court to try and achieve the best possible result for them on the day.
			  </p>

			  <p>
			  Samir practices in all aspects of family law, but has a particular interest in Children Act cases in which he has developed extensive knowledge and experience, having dealt with the more straightforward cases dealing with child arrangements orders (previously residence and contact)to the very complex cases which involve issues such as special guardianship, child abduction, international relocation, emergency orders for the protection of a child in a domestic violence situation, welfare or child abduction situation and financial applications on behalf of a child.
			  </p>
