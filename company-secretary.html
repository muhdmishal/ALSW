              <h1>Company Secretary/Legal Compliance</h1>
              <p>
                There is no longer a statutory requirement for a company to have a company secretary, however directors continue to be liable for legal non-compliance and the penalties can be severe. In most cases we advise our clients that it is prudent to appoint a secretary to help protect the company and directors. We are pleased to be able to provide company secretary services for a fixed annual fee to ensure that your company complies with all statutory and other legal requirements as amended from time to time.
              </p>
              <p>
                As company secretary we provide the following services all included in our fixed annual fee:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>	Maintaining the companyâ€™s statutory books including drafting board minutes and shareholder resolutions in accordance with the law.</li>
                <li>	Advising directors of their legal duties and responsibilities to the company. </li>
                <li>	Providing a company registered office address for official documents.</li>
                <li>	Completing and filing all Companies House forms.</li>
                <li>	Completing and filing annual returns.</li>
                <li>	Ensuring general compliance with the Companies Act 2006 as amended.</li>
