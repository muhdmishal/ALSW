              <h1>Defending a Claim</h1>
              <p>
                If an employee has brought a claim to the Employment Tribunal against your business, we are able to assist you throughout this legal process.
              </p>
              <p>
                The majority of employment claims must be presented at the Tribunal within strict time limits. The time limits are very short, usually three months and vary depending on the type of claim. Sometimes it is difficult to determine the correct date from when the time limit should begin. It is important to seek advice as a claim may successfully be disposed of early on if it has been submitted out of time.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a claim has been made against you, you will receive an employee's ET1 form which will set out details of the employees claim. You are required to respond to this form within 28 days of receipt. This would involve drafting the ET3 form in which you should respond to each allegation made by the employee. This is a complicated document to draft and will be relied upon throughout the proceedings. It is therefore vital that this document is drafted carefully.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once your ET3 response is filed the Employment Tribunal Chairman will timetable the case by making directions (often standard in straightforward cases) for the exchange of documents and a date for the hearing will be provided.
              </p>
