              <h1>Failing To Stop After An Accident</h1>
              <p>
                If you are involved in an accident and fail to stop and give your name and address to any person who is injured or whose property is damaged, even if the accident is no fault of your own, you will be guilty of an offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988.
              </p>
              <p>
                The penalty for failing to stop is a fine of up to Â£5,000, from 5 - 10 penalty points and discretionary disqualification.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Act is open to interpretation in relation to the definition of terms such as "accident" and "stop". There are also a number of Defences which may apply, such as where you were unaware that an accident had occurred or where you did stop and wait for a reasonable time and we have secured a number of acquittals presenting such defences.
