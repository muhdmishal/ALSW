              <p>Coping with the death of a friend, family member or loved one is difficult at the best of times. Yet, it can be even harder, if that death occurred unexpectedly or in unusual circumstances.</p>

              <p>Sometimes, when this happens, a Coroner can order that an inquest should take place to find out what went wrong and what the cause of death was. That inquest will be a formal court procedure, where witnesses are asked questions under oath,evidence is considered and a verdict is reached.</p>

              <p>At Aletta Shaw, we appreciate how daunting the prospect of an inquest can be.</p>

              <p>Whatever your circumstances may be… we’re here to help.</p>

              <p>Not only will we advise you about the nature of the inquest itself, we can represent you at the hearing, by putting questions to witnesses and making submissions on your behalf. We’ll deal with your case sympathetically, and work tirelessly to ensure that you get all the answers,as well as the peace of mind you deserve.</p>

              <p>We also understand that there may be financial implications arising out of your loved one’s death, particularly if they have young children or dependents. If that’s the case, we can advise you about whether there’s any help you can get, or compensation you can claim.</p>

              <p>While we know there’s nothing we can do to bring them back, we’ll do our best to make sure that you’re on a firm financial footing for the future.</p>
