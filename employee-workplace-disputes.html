              <p>
                If you have a grievance or a problem at your place of work, it is important to deal with it early on, before it becomes an issue which could put your job or your health at risk.
              </p>
              <p>
                Whether it be unfair treatment, bullying and harassment, health and safety issues, poor management or increase in workload, we can assist you by advising you of your legal rights, the correct procedure to follow and how to effectively put your position to your employer/manager at a grievance meeting.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your employer does not deal with your grievance properly and sensitively then you may have a case to make a claim to the employment tribunal. It is important that before you consider taking such action you follow the correct procedure and work with your employer to try to resolve the grievance or conflict internally or with the help of a third party such as a mediator.
              </p>
              <p>
                If such action becomes necessary then we can advise you of the merits of your case. It is important to bear in mind that a claim brought without a realistic prospect of success could you result in an order that you should pay your employerâ€™s legal costs.
              </p>
