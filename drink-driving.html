              <p>
                A conviction for drink driving or failing to provide a specimen will lead to an automatic minimum 12-month disqualification from driving and a fine. If you were found to be several times over the limit or this is a second or subsequent offence then you could face a much longer ban, a substantial fine or imprisonment. The effect of a conviction may also be much more far reaching in that you will have a criminal record. Your livelihood can also be at risk. If you drive for a living or work as a professional You may be required to report the conviction to your governing body you could risk losing your job.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is important that you know your rights and seek dedicated advice from a specialist motoring offences solicitor.

              <p>
                There are a number of defences that can be put forward to counter such charges, such as where the person drove the car while over the limit in an emergency or due to threats of death or serious injury, or where the police have not followed the strict procedures which should be adhered to when obtaining samples. Our solicitors will be able to advise you of your chances of successfully defending your case, prepare arguments and arrange representation to help your case. Scientific evidence can be used in support of your defence.
              </p>
