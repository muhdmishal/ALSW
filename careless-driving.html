              <p>
                A person drives carelessly if they drive a car or any mechanically propelled vehicle, in a way that falls far below what would be expected of a competent and careful driver, he/she could face a conviction for careless driving.
              </p>
              <p>
                Although there are situations, such as overtaking on the inside, using a mobile phone while driving, driving through a red light etc, which are more likely to lead to a conviction, other actions are not so clear cut. For example, would blowing your nose, whilst you are stationary with the handbrake on, or talking to a passenger amount to an offence?
              </p>
              <p>
                In view of the ambiguity, there may be many situations when charges are brought unreasonably. There may also be situations where there is a defence to the charge, such as where the driver lost control of the vehicle due to a mechanical defect or where, as a result of threats of violence the driver drove the way he/she did for fear of death or of being physically injured. The Police may have lied or exaggerated in their account of what happened.
              </p>
              <p>
                In such circumstances representation is highly recommended as the legal argument which will need to be put to the court can be very complex. We are used to cross-examining police witnesses and ensuring your case is presented in the best possible light.
              </p>
              <p>
                The penalty for careless driving is a fine and obligatory penalty points of between 3 - 9 points. The court can in certain circumstances disqualify the driver. As a result of "totting up" the driver may be at risk of losing his/her licence in any event if the imposition of penalty points brings the total number of penalty points to over 12 in any 3 year period.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where there is a risk of disqualification then we can provide you with representation at court to ensure that the points are kept to a minimum or we can make representations on your behalf where there is a case of exceptional hardship. Examples of exceptional hardship are where a disqualification would result in the loss of a job or a restriction on mobility in the case of a disabled driver.
