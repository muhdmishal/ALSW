              <h1 class="page-title">Accidents at Work Solicitors</h1>
              <p>Unfortunately, accidents do happen at work.</p>
              <p>You may be suffering from repetitive strain injury because of a badly designed work station, or have slipped and tripped over cabling in the office.</p>
              <p>No matter how big or small your claim may be, here at Aletta Shaw, our experienced lawyers are able to handle your case and help you win the compensation you deserve.</p>
              <p>We’ll be able to recover any medical costs or out-of-pocket expenses that you may have incurred, as well as damages for pain and suffering. You may even be entitled to damages for loss of earnings, if your injury meant that you couldn’t work.</p>
              <p>What’s more, at Aletta Shaw, we’re renowned for our friendly and personal service. We’ll be handling your claim from one of our offices in either Bexleyheath or Chislehurst, so you’ll never have to travel far to see a solicitor, or speak to an anonymous call-centre about your case again!</p>
              <p>So, if you think we can help you, call us today on 020 8301 4884 or send an email to enquiries@alettashaw.com. You’ll speak to one of our specialist lawyers and they’ll advise you whether you’re entitled to compensation for your accident at work.</p>
              <p>As well as that, if you’re worried about the cost of bringing a claim or our legal fees… Don’t be.</p>
              <p>We’re surprisingly affordable.</p>
              <p>We may even be able to take on your case under a ‘no-win, no-fee’ agreement or through funding from your insurance company.</p>
              <p>Call us at Aletta Shaw today on 0208 301 4884 to book an initial consultation with one of our lawyers, or alternatively, use the contact form on the right of the screen and we’ll arrange a meeting with you.</p>
