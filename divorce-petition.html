              <h1 class="page-title">Petitioning for Divorce</h1>
              <p>Either the husband or wife can apply to the court for a divorce, provided they have been married for more than a year and one or the other of them resides in England or Wales. The person who starts the divorce proceedings is known as ‘the petitioner’ and his or her spouse is called ‘the respondent’.</p>
              <p>There is only one ground for divorce and that is that the marriage has broken down irretrievably.  It is not possible to obtain a divorce where a couple decide to separate just because they do not get on. To satisfy the Court that there has been an irretrievable breakdown the petitioner must prove one of the following five facts:</p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>	The respondent has committed adultery and the petitioner finds it intolerable to live with the Respondent.</li>
                <li>	The respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.</li>
                <li>	The respondent has deserted the petitioner for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before the start of the divorce.</li>
                <li>	The parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least two years immediately before the start of the divorce and the respondent consents to a decree being granted.</li>
                <li>	The parties to the marriage have lived apart for a continuous period of at least five years immediately before the start of the divorce.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>In relation to the period of desertion or living apart, no account is taken of any period or periods of less than six months in total, during which the parties lived together and any periods of reconciliation can be counted as part of the period of desertion or separation.  Periods of reconciliation of more than six months will automatically break the continuity of the separation.</p>
              <p>In the case of adultery, if the parties live together for a period of six months after the petitioner became aware of the adultery, then, he or she would not be able to petition on the basis of that act of adultery.  If there are a number of acts of adultery then the time starts running from the last act of adultery.</p>
              <p>For the purposes of the two and five year separation facts, it is possible to be living under the same roof but still “living apart�?.  However, you will need to show that you have been leading completely separate existences.</p>
              <h3>Procedure</h3>
              <p>A divorce petition and any necessary supporting documents, including, if there are children, a statement of arrangements for the children, setting out the details of the day to day care for the children will be drafted and filed at court.   The marriage certificate must be filed at the same time.</p>
              <p>The court will then serve the proceedings on the respondent, who should indicate whether he/she is in agreement to a divorce or not, by completing an acknowledgement of service form provided to him/her by the court.  There is a timescale within which the acknowledgement of service should be returned.  If this does not happen the petitioner will have to consider how to prove to the court that the papers have been received by the respondent, either by making an application for ‘deemed service’ or by asking the court bailiff to personally serve the respondent.  This will cause delay and result in additional costs.</p>
              <p>If the respondent decides to defend the proceedings the costs will increase substantially, together with the time needed to conclude the divorce.  There may even need to be a court hearing.</p>
              <p>If the respondent does not defend the petition and returns the acknowledgement of service form to the court confirming this, the divorce can proceed.  The court will send a copy of the acknowledgement of service to the petitioner.  The petitioner will then prepare a short statement in support of the petition, updating the court in relation to any changes in either party’s circumstances since the filing of the petition.  This must be signed by the petitioner and then sent to the court with a request that the court consider the divorce petition.</p>
              <p>When considering the divorce petition and whether the legal criteria for a divorce are satisfied, the court will also check any proposed arrangements for children, if appropriate and will consider who should pay the costs.  If the court is satisfied that there are grounds for divorce notice of the date on which the decree nisi is to be pronounced is sent to both parties, shortly after which, parties will receive the decree nisi.  The decree nisi is the legal document which confirms that the court can see no reason why the parties cannot be divorced.  This is the first of two orders necessary to bring the marriage to an end.  It is not the final order itself and therefore you cannot remarry at this stage.</p>
              <p>After the decree nisi is pronounced, the petitioner can apply for the final order, the decree absolute, six weeks and one day later.  In certain circumstances the court can refuse to allow a decree absolute, for example, where there are any unresolved disputes over the children.</p>
              <p>It is possible for the divorce to be put on hold at any time prior to the decree absolute being pronounced.  If done prior to the decree nisi being pronounced it is also possible to dismiss the divorce proceedings.  If the decree nisi is pronounced it may be possible to rescind it in certain circumstances, for example where there is a reconciliation.</p>
              <h3>Timescale</h3>
              <p>Based on current court times the divorce will take approximately 5 – 7 months to complete, dependent upon the speed documents are dealt with and whether the proceedings are defended.  If the respondent objects, or defends the proceedings, the time may well be much longer.  As the court have no control over the number of petitions that are filed, this timescale will vary in accordance with their backlog.</p>
              <p>If the petitioner does not, for some reason, apply for the decree nisi to be made absolute, then the respondent may apply three months, six weeks and one day after the date of the pronouncement of the decree nisi.  If the respondent does apply, then there will have to be a court hearing to determine whether the decree absolute should be granted. In this case the timescale above would be much longer and more costly.  </p>
              <p>Where there are financial issues, it is usual for the petitioner to wait for the financial settlement to be agreed before applying to the court for the decree nisi to be made absolute.  An application by the respondent prior to that, unless there is some very good reason, is not normally advised due to the additional costs involved.</p>
