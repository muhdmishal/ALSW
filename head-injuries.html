              <p>At Aletta Shaw, we know how difficult it is if a friend, family member or loved one suffers from a head injury.</p>


              <p>They may have lost their memory, undergone a personality change and even have trouble communicating with you. Similarly, you may find that you have to help them with simple, everyday tasks, like cooking, washing and dressing, which they once took for granted. That can be frustrating… for everyone.</p>

              <p>From our offices in Bexleyheath and Chislehurst, we can help you claim compensation for your loved one’s head injury, if someone else was at fault. For example, they might have been injured in a road traffic accident, at work or following a criminal assault.</p>

              <p>Whatever the circumstances may be... we’re here to help.</p>

              <p>While we can’t guarantee that your loved one will make a full recovery, we do promise to work tirelessly on their behalf to make sure they get the damages they deserve, for medical fees, rehabilitation costs and pain and suffering, as well as any adaptations and equipment they might need.</p>

              <p>So, if you think we can help, call us at Aletta Shaw today on 0208 301 4884 and ask to speak to one of our specialist head injury lawyers. Alternatively, use the contact form on the right of the screen and we’ll arrange an initial consultation with you.</p>
