              <h1>Road Traffic Accident Solicitors</h1>

              <p>Every year, thousands of motorists, passengers and pedestrians are injured in accidents on the road. Many of them will suffer from minor bruising or cuts and grazes as a result, but for some people, their injuries can be much more serious and even disabling.</p>

              <p>No matter how big or small your road traffic claim may be, here at Aletta Shaw, our experienced lawyers are able to handle your case and help you win the compensation you deserve.</p>

              <p>We’ll be able to recover any medical costs or out-of-pocket expenses that you may have incurred, as well as damages for pain and suffering. You may even be entitled to damages for loss of earnings, if your injury meant that you couldn’t work.</p>

              <p>What’s more, at Aletta Shaw, we’re renowned for our friendly and personal service. We’ll be handling your claim from one of our offices in either Bexleyheath or Chislehurst, so you’ll never have to travel far to see a solicitor, or speak to an anonymouscall-centre about your case again!</p>

              <p>So, if you think we can help you, call us today on 020 8301 4884 or send an email to enquiries@alettashaw.com. You’ll speak to one of our specialist lawyers and they’ll advise you whether you’re entitled to compensation for your road traffic accident.</p>

              <p>As well as that, if you’re worried about the cost of bringing a claim or our legal fees... Don’t be.</p>

              <p>We’re surprisingly affordable.</p>

              <p>We may even be able to take on your case under a ‘no-win, no-fee’ agreement or through funding from your insurance company.</p>
