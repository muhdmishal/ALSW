              <h2>What is a settlement agreement?</h2>
              <p>
                A settlement agreement (known as a compromise agreement prior to the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/24/contents">Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013)</a> is a legally binding agreement between a business and an employee under which an employer will pay to an employee financial compensation in return for an employee agreeing to settle their potential claims.  A settlement agreement can include an agreed reference or the continuation of other benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                Under new provisions which have been inserted into the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/18/contents">Employment Rights Act 1996</a> settlement agreement discussions cannot now be used as evidence within Tribunal proceedings.
              </p>
              <h2>When will a settlement agreement usually arise?</h2>
              <p>
                Claims may arise on recruitment, whilst an employee is still employed by a company or after the employee’s contract of employment has terminated.  An agreement will usually be in return for an employee leaving the business, or to settle an existing claim in a way that allows the employee to continue working within the business and to salvage the working relationship.
              </p>
              <p>
                They can help bring a dignified end to an employer/employee relationship which has broken down and can prevent the costs and stress of an employment tribunal claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                What requirements need to be satisfied in order for there to be a valid settlement agreement?
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>	It must be in writing.</li>
                <li>	It must relate to a particular complaint or particular proceedings.</li>
                <li>	The employee must have received legal advice from a relevant independent adviser (for example, a qualified lawyer or union official) about the terms and effect of the proposed agreement and its effect on their ability to pursue any rights before an employment tribunal.</li>
                <li>	The independent adviser must have a current contract of insurance (or professional indemnity insurance) covering the risk of a potential claim against them by the employee for the advice.</li>
                <li>	The employee’s adviser must be identified.</li>
                <li>	The agreement must specifically state that the conditions regulating settlement agreements have been satisfied.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We shall ensure that any legal requirements are met on your behalf.
              </p>
              <h2>Which types of claim can be settled by a settlement agreement?</h2>
              <p>
                A large number of statutory claims can be settled by a settlement agreement, for example:
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>	Unfair dismissal.</li>
                <li>	Discrimination, victimisation or harassment</li>
                <li>	Pregnancy or maternity-related discrimination  </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Which common clauses are included within a settlement agreement?</h2>
              <p>
                We would usually expect the following clauses to be within settlement agreements;
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>	Compensation for loss of employment. This will usually be tax free up to £30,000. </li>
                <li>	A contribution to legal fees. Your employer will usually pay your legal fees relating to advice given in relation to the contents of the agreement. </li>
                <li>	A list of potential claims that the employee agrees to settle in return for financial compensation. </li>
                <li>	Imposition of a restrictive covenants or modification of a covenant. These clauses will often stop you from doing something, such as working for a rival company and therefore it is important that they are dealt with reasonably and appropriately. </li>
                <li>	Indemnity from employee in relation to tax and National Insurance Contributions. As an employee receives the benefit of the money, it is usual for the employee to offer an indemnity. </li>
                <li>	Clauses protecting confidential information are usually crucial to a business and therefore settlement agreements often contain confidentiality provisions, for example, the employee agrees:<br>
                  Not to use any confidential information of the business.<br>
                  Not to disclose any confidential information to any third party.<br>
                  To keep the terms and existence of the settlement agreement confidential from immediate family members, prospective recruitment consultants etc.<br>
                  Not to make any derogatory comments about the employer (or any individuals employed by it) to a third party.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h2>Which types of claim cannot be settled by a settlement agreement?</h2>
              <p>
                There are a number of statutory claims that cannot be settled by way of a settlement agreement, these include some types of:
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>	Personal injury claims.</li>
                <li>	Pension claims.</li>
                <li>	Claims following the transfer of a business.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Acas has published a booklet entitled <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/media/pdf/o/a/Settlement_agreements_%28the_Acas_Guide%29JULY2013.pdf">‘Settlement Agreements:</a> A Guide’ which explains what settlement agreements are, their effect and how to effectively negotiate terms.

              </p>
              <p>
                In order for the agreement to be legally binding you must have received independent legal advice in relation to the agreement from a suitably qualified legal adviser. In most cases the employer pays the legal costs. As there is a legal requirement for the employee to have independent legal advice it has become usual practice for them to do so.
