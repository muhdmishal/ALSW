              <p>
                Domestic violence may take the form of serious physical abuse or behaviour which is psychologically harmful to include belittling or more subtle harassment such as withholding money or threatening to withhold money.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can prepare your application for an injunction and if appropriate an order saying who should live in the family home. If necessary we can make an emergency application. We will arrange for you to be represented at the court hearing.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have been wrongly accused of domestic violence we can arrange for you to be represented at an injunction hearing. We can prepare a detailed statement for you explaining your side of the story. This may be very important as the Judge may only have seen your partnerâ€™s written evidence and you may not be given the opportunity to give oral evidence in sufficient detail.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a non molestation order is made, any breach is automatically a criminal offence and you can be arrested without a warrant and could receive up to a maximum sentence of 5 years imprisonment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where the application also deals with the issue of who should reside at the family home we can help you ensure that your right to remain in the property is protected. An order made preventing you from going near the family home could also impact on the contact you have with your children or in relation to financial issues. It is therefore important that you are represented at any hearing so that all issues are properly considered by the court.
