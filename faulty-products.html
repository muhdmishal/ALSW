              <h1 class="page-title">Faulty Products</h1>
              <p>In the UK, we spend millions of pounds everyday on the high street. More often than not, we’re happy with our purchases, but sometimes, the goods we buy can be unsafe and may even cause us harm. For example:</p>

              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>Your skin may have been irritated by a cosmetic product.</li>
                <li>Your child may have been injured, playing with a defective toy.</li>
                <li>You may even have had adverse side-effects from taking a prescription medicine.</li>
                <li>Whatever your circumstances may be, here at Aletta Shaw, our experienced lawyers can help you claim compensation from retailers, manufacturers or distributors, if you’ve been injured by a faulty product.</li>
              </ul>

              <p>We’ll be able to recover any medical fees that you may have incurred, as well as damages for pain and suffering. You may even be entitled to compensation for loss of earnings, if your injury meant that you were unable to work.</p>

              <p>What’s more, with offices in Bexleyheath and Chislehurst, we promise you’ll never have to travel far to see a solicitor again, or speak to an anonymous call-centre about your case.</p>

              <p>We may even be able to take your claim on under a ‘no-win, no-fee’ agreement, or through funding from your insurance company.</p>

              <p>So, to speak to someone about your faulty product claims, call us at Aletta Shaw on 0208 301 4884 todayto book an initial consultation with one of our specialist lawyers. Alternatively, send an email to enquiries@alettashaw.com and we’ll be in touch with you.</p>
