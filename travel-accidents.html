              <h1>Travel Accident Claims</h1>

              <p>Holidays are meant to be relaxing, but sometimes, things can and do go wrong during our week away in the sun. For example:

              <ul>
                <li>Your plane may be delayed.</li>
                <li>You may contract an illness from staying in a hotel or on a cruise ship.</li>
                <li>You may even be injured in an accident on the roads.</li>
              </ul>
