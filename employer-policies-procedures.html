                Employment Law is continually being updated or changed. It is more important than ever to ensure that your business manages employment issues in accordance with employment legislation. We are able to draft policies and procedures for your business, tailored to suit your business needs and to give you peace of mind in the knowledge that you are compliant with the current law, leaving you to devote your time to the productivity and promotion of your business.
              </p>

                It is vital to have policies and procedures in place to minimise the risk of an employment claim. Many routine problems relating to employment issues can be effectively and quickly handled if the correct documentation is in place. It is important to have policies in place to cover all areas in which a claim may arise. These policies can range from a no smoking policy or email policy to grievance or disciplinary policies.

                A well drafted policy can ensure that employees are aware of what is expected of them to ensure the high standards of your business are maintained. The policies allow you to exercise control over the way your employees conduct themselves in the course of their employment which can impact on the reputation and success of your business. Proper implementation of the policies can help prevent problems arising in the first place. In addition, where a problem arises, matters can be dealt with in accordance with the relevant policy procedure so that they are resolved internally rather than through an Employment Tribunal.
              </p>
              <p>
                Drafting policies, procedures and your staff handbook/employment manual can be daunting, time consuming and complicated. We can take away the stress for you and ensure that your policies are fair (which is a requirement by law) and compliant with current legislation. Should an employee proceed to make an employment claim against your business, your policies and procedures will often be used as evidence at the Employment Tribunal and can assist you in defending a claim. It is therefore essential that they are well drafted and correctly adhered to.
