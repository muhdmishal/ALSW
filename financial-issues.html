                If there are financial issues to be dealt with on your divorce/dissolution of civil partnership, we can help you as much or as little as you wish, depending upon your budget, from initial advice through to the complicated and lengthy process of bringing an application through the courts. In certain cases we are able to offer a client credit agreement. This means that you would only need to make a very small contribution towards your legal costs throughout the proceedings. We would receive our payment under the credit agreement which will be recovered from you at the conclusion of the proceedings.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have been able to reach agreement with your spouse/civil partner, then it is very important that you file the appropriate papers at the court so that no claim can be brought against you at a later date. If you do not do so you could find that several years down the line your former spouse/civil partner comes back for another bite of the cherry, when you have moved on and settled into a new life. We can prepare the appropriate papers for you for a competitive fixed fee and at the same time we will be able to advise you whether the settlement is fair taking into account the circumstances of your case.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our solicitors are able to deal with all types of financial disputes from the more straight forward cases involving just the family home or pension provision, to the more complex bigger money cases. We can advise you early on the merits of settling your case or pursuing an application through the court process. If an application to court becomes necessary, we can arrange for you to be represented at Court by some of the most experienced barristers in this specialist area of law to ensure that you have the best outcome.
