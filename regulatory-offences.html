              <h1>Regulatory Offences</h1>
              <p>
                The business world is becoming increasingly regulated and directors or individuals can be investigated and possibly prosecuted by any number of organisations, such as the Health and Safety Executive, Environment Agency, Local Authority Trading Standards, Customs & Excise etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this happens it is important to make early contact with someone who can offer you sound legal advice. We can then work with you at the early stages to prevent an action being brought against you, through negotiation. If your case has gone past the investigation stage we can provide you with the specialist advice to help you defend a prosecution.
              </p>
              <h2>Profession Regulation</h2>
              <p>
                We can assist you if you are involved in <a href="professional-offences.html">disciplinary or fitness to practice</a> proceedings taken by your regulatory body, such as the General Medical Council, General Dental Council, Royal College of Vetenary Surgeons etc.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can assist you at the early stages in dealing with an initial complaint or later in any disciplinary or regulatory or fitness to proceedings.
              </p>
              <p>
                In view of our expertise in criminal and matters we will also be able to advise you in relation to any related criminal issues.

              <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
              <p>
                Many firms of solicitors dealing with criminal cases instruct in-house solicitor advocates, often with limited experience. At Aletta Shaw we always instruct specialist barristers from highly reputable criminal chambers.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are able to achieve outstanding results by taking time to understand the circumstances of your case, by making an in depth analysis of the evidence that the prosecution are relying on and by arranging quality expert witnesses to help with the presentation of forensic and medical evidence where appropriate.
              </p>
              <p>
                We will always keep you up to date with developments in your case and help you understand the legal issues as they arise throughout.
