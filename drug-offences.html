              <p>
                There can be very severe penalties for drug offences including long custodial sentences or heavy fines. The severity of the sentence will depend on the classification of the drug, the seriousness of the offence and whether there are aggravating or mitigating factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                We can help investigate your case. It is important to have a solicitor who knows the right qustions to ask to obtain crucial evidence in support of your defence. We have the expertise to offer you the support you need, whether it is a simple possession case or a more complicated case involving large scale trafficking and multiple co-defendents.
              </p>
              <h2>Substances under classification</h2>
              <p>
                Class A <br>
                Heroin, Ecstasy, LSD, Crack, Cocaine, Magic Mushrooms, amphetamines (for injecting).
              </p>
              <p>
                Class B <br>
                Pholcodine, Methylphenidate, Cannabis, Amphetamines.
              </p>
              <p>
                Class C <br>
                Ketamine, Gamma-Hydroxybutyrate acid (GHB), tranquilisers, certain painkillers.
              </p>
              <h2>Possession</h2>
              <p>
                This offence is committed if caught in possession of a controlled substance, that is a Class A drug, or a â€˜more than minimal amount of class B or C drug. The maximum sentence is a 7 year prison sentence, although unless there are aggravating circumstances a prison sentence would be unusual.
              </p>
              <h2>Possession with intent to supply</h2>
              <p>
                This is treated more seriously than a simple possession case and is tried in a Crown Court. A custodial sentence is usual and the length of the sentence will depend upon the quantity and strength of the drugs and any aggravating factors.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you wish to enter a guilty plea we can assist in ensuring that any sentence/fine is kept to a minimum. Factors which can be taken into account include a situation where the accused was placed under pressure to commit the crime or where the offence was committed to fund a drug habit.
              </p>
              <h2>Importation, Exportation and Production</h2>
              <p>
                These are the most serious drug offences. Such cases often involve large organisations where large quantities of drugs are involved. Evidence can be complex, involving mobile phone evidence, sat nav evidence or forensic evidence and there may well be multi-defendants.
              </p>
              <p>
                There are a number of defences which can be advanced and good forensic or other evidence are vital. We will make a thorough and detailed investigation and arrange appropriate expert evidence to counteract any prosecution evidence and to support any defence.
              </p>
              <p>
                In these type of cases sentences and fines can be very severe and should you intend to plead guilty you will need a good lawyer to advance clear legal argument to ensure that your sentence/fine is kept to a minimum.
              </p>
              <p>

                The courts will also consider confiscating the proceeds of crime and any assets in your posession may be at risk including your home.
