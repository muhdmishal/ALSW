              <h2>Employment Solicitor</h2>
              <p>
               Samir joined the firm as a Trainee Solicitor and following admission as solicitor he expanded the Employment Law department providing advice to both employers and employees. He has been able to expand this department due to his reputation in this field has resulted in many referrals from former clients.
              </p>

			  <p>
			  His broad knowledge over several areas of law allows him to find pragmatic and effective solutions to matters that he is instructed on.
			  </p>

			  <p>
			  Samir is known to robustly present his client’s cases, to exercise excellent tactical judgement and effectively put his client’s position forward.
			  </p>

			  <p>
			  He regularly advises both companies and individuals in relation to employment matters both within Tribunal proceedings and in relation to settlement agreements and ongoing work issues. Samir recently defended an Employer within Tribunal proceedings in a complex matter where a claim for Unfair Dismissal and a breach of TUPE regulations were brought by five claimants. Within just over a month, Samir, through effective, swift negotiations ensured that all five claimants had withdrawn their claims bringing a cost effective conclusion for the delighted client. Samir is equally at home representing employees and recently obtained a £50,000 settlement in relation to a complex claim for whistle-blowing and constructive dismissal.
