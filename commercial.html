              <p>
                Our Company Commercial team has a wealth of experience across all areas of Company, Commercial and Business Law. We are practical and robust in our approach to business and legal problems in order to achieve the best outcomes for our clients. Legal expertise combined with a deep understanding of practical commerce makes Aletta Shaw the ideal choice across London and the South East.
              </p>
              <p>
                Common business principals run through all the work we do, however we know that each client is different with their own unique set of circumstances. We carefully tailor our advice to meet the specific needs of each business. Our client care is second to none.
              </p>
              <p>
                Aletta Shaw are pleased to be in the strong position of providing a first class central London service for a low cost local price across the full spectrum of Company and Commercial law. Our overheads are much lower than central London firms to whom our legal knowledge and expertise compares. We are able to provide some fixed fee services and a fixed cap on fees for more complex work such as company purchases and sales.
              </p>
              <p>
                Fixed Fee services include:
              </p>
              <ul class="expertise">
                <li>	Initial face-to-face meeting at a place suitable to you.</li>
                <li>	Forming new companies.</li>
                <li>	Company secretary services.</li>
                <li>	Drafting shareholder/partnership agreements.</li>
                <li>	Advising on third party standard terms.</li>
