              <h1>Redundancy Solicitors</h1>
              <p>
                There are times when a company must make redundancies, for example as a result of financial difficulties, or where there is a lack of work in a particular area of the companies business. It is important to seek legal advice on how to handle this legal process and ensure that all legal obligations are carried out by you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Redundancy is a potentially fair reason for dismissing an employee, however, it is an area of law which is high risk for employers, should the process be carried out incorrectly. The redundancy process must be a fair one from start to finish, ranging from obligations to look for alternative employment within your business for employees, to the selection criteria used to select employees for redundancy.
              </p>
              <p>
                If a redundancy situation arises and an employee makes a claim to an Employment Tribunal, we offer representation to defend the claim. We can negotiate on your behalf to attempt to resolve matters as early as possible. We can prepare legal paperwork on your behalf. We ensure that we work as efficiently and cost effective as possible for your business and keep you up to date with costs regularly so you can plan the budget of your business effectively.
