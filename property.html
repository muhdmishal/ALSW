              <h2>Quality</h2>
              <p>
                Aletta Shaw's dedicated property law team is based in our Bexleyheath office and provides conveyancing services to Kent and South East London. The team have expertise in residential and commercial conveyancing ranging from the sale of the family home to much larger corporate acquisitions. We pride ourselves in providing a highly professional service and a personal and tailored approach to client care.
              </p>
              <p>
                At Aletta Shaw the person who will have primary responsibility for all your property work will be a solicitor or licensed conveyancer. This is not always the case at other legal practices. Clients of some firms are told that their work is being carried out by a 'lawyer'. Many people are not aware that the general term 'lawyer' does not necessarily mean that person actually holds any legal qualifications.
              </p>
              <h2>Value</h2>
              <p>
                We offer fixed fees for all residential property transactions and also where possible for commercial transactions.
              </p>
              <p>
                For those who find the process stressful you will find us approachable and always able to take time to explain things in language which is clear and easy to understand. As one client described the service they received "hard work, professionalism, quick response, swift turnaround and more important your ‘can do’ attitude which made the process painless for us."
              </p>
