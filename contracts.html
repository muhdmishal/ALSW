              <p>
                We are able to assist your business with the drafting of employment contracts for your employees. We are able to tailor employment contracts to the needs of your business.
              </p>
              <p>
                By law you, as an employer, have a duty to provide your employees, at the very minimum with a written statement of particulars of employment, containing basic information such as their salary, dates of employment and their job title, within two months of the employee starting work for your business. There could be financial penalties for not doing so.
              </p>
              <p>
                A carefully drafted contract can offer protection to your business by preventing an employee from doing something which may detrimentally affect your business. For example, you can prevent your employee from disclosing confidential information about your business to third parties or your business competitors, or can prevent an employee from soliciting or poaching clients, customers or staff from your business. Contracts also place obligations on you or your employees in specific situations such as termination of employment so that each party is clear as to their position should that situation arise.
              </p>
