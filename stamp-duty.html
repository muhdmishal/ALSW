              <h1 class="page-title">Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) changes</h1>
              <h2>4th December 2014</h2>
              <p>
                Significant changes to the level of SDLT payable on the purchase of a property have been introduced by George Osborne in his Autumn Statement. Many believe that it is a much fairer system as it is now applied at different rates depending upon the portion of the purchase price that falls into each rate band, rather than as a single percentage of the overall purchase price. George Osborne believes that as many as 98% of homebuyers will benefit.
              </p>
              <p>
                Those who have already exchanged contracts and who will be completing today or later, can chose whether they want to pay the Tax in accordance with the old rules of the new rules.
              </p>

              <p>
                SDLT is charged at 15% on residential dwellings costing more than £500,000 bought by bodies such as companies and collective investment schemes, unless the property is to be used for a property rental business, a property development or resale trade or for providing admission to visitors on a commercial basis, in which case you pay SDLT based on the new rates and bands.
              </p>
              <h3>Residential leases</h3>
              <p>
                If your residential lease is for more than £125,000, you will pay 1% SDLT on the amount above the £125,000 threshold.
