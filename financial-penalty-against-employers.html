              <h1 class="page-title">Financial penalty against employers that breach employment rights</h1>
              <h3>11 February 2014</h3>
              <p>
                The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 which received the Royal Assent on 25th April 2013 has introduced a discretionary power for tribunals to impose a financial penalty on employers who breach employment rights in circumstances where there are one or more “aggravating factors�?.  The provisions are to be implemented in April this year.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Act does not define what “aggravating features�? are and it is therefore unclear how this section of the Act will be applied in practice.  It is thought that issues such as the behaviour of the employer, for example if they have been negligent, malicious or their actions are deliberate will be considered as aggravating features.  The size of the employer, the duration of the breach and the employer’s conduct within the proceedings may also be considered to have constituted an aggravating feature.
              </p>
              <p>The penalty will be between £1,000 and £5,000, based on 50% of the award made against the employer.  Any penalty awarded is reduced by half if paid within 21 Days.
