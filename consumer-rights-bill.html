              <h1>Consumer Rights Bill</h1>
              <h3>March 2014</h3>
              <p>
                The Consumer Rights Bill was introduced into the House of Commons on 23rd January 2014.  A draft bill, following consultation with consumers, businesses, enforcers and examination of reports and consultations by the Law commission, was published on 12th June 2013.  The Bill completed its committee stage on 13th March 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                The Bill aims to clarify, simplify and consolidate consumer rights in relation to contracts for goods, services, digital content and unfair terms in consumer contracts.  It introduces easier routes for the challenge of anti-competitive behaviour and it simplifies powers relating to the investigation of breaches of consumer law.
              </p>
              <p>
                The proposed reforms streamline consumer rights and remedies by putting them in one place.  The Bill promotes the use of plain words and introduces a new regime relating to digital content.  The aim being to make it easier for consumers to understand the law and to ensure that consumers are better protected    Businesses will also benefit from the proposed changes as deregulation will mean that less time and money will need to be spent on training staff and sorting out disputes.
              </p>
              <p>The Bill sets a time period of 30 days from the date of purchase during which the consumer must be given a full refund if goods purchased are faulty.  This is the case even if, as under current law they have ‘accepted’ those goods, by acting in a way which would be inconsistent with the seller’s ownership or by failing to notify the seller within a reasonable amount of time that they intended to reject them.
              </p>
              <p>After 30 days, the consumer would need to accept only one replacement or repair of faulty goods before being entitled to some money back.
              </p>
              <p>For the first six months from the sale of the goods, traders cannot reduce any refund on the basis that the consumer has had the benefit of the goods during that period unless there is an active second-hand market in the specific goods purchased.
              </p>
              <p>Under the Bill ‘conditions’, ‘warranties’ and ‘implied terms’, which are complicated legal terms are replaced by language which can be more easily understood so that consumers and business are clear about standards that goods must meet.
              </p>
              <p>
                In relation to digital content, this is to be defined as ‘data which are produced and supplied in digital form.’  Digital content must match the description under which it was provided, be of satisfactory quality and fit for purpose.
              </p>
              <p>The Bill introduces statutory rights for consumers where services offered are not carried out with reasonable care and skill.
              </p>
              <p>
                Where assessing whether the terms of a contract are unfair a “Grey List�? makes clear which terms might be regarded as unfair.
              </p>
              <p>Trading Standards Services will be able to work across local authority boundaries and there is also to be an amendment to the Weights and Measures (Package Goods) Regulations 2006 whereby bakers will be automatically exempt from the requirement under the legislation reducing the burden on businesses and enforcers.
              </p>
              <p>Changes to competition law will also take place, to make it easier for consumers to challenge anti-competitive behaviour, which, under current law is difficult to show, due to its complex nature and can therefore be very costly to prove.
