              <p>
                It is extremely important to obtain legal advice when faced with a disciplinary hearing. It is a hugely stressful time in your life, as it could result in you losing your job or receiving a final warning.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lawyers are generally not permitted to attend any hearing on your behalf, although, they may be able to if the consequence of a finding against you could result in you being unable to practise in your career again. You are allowed to bring a trade union representative or fellow work colleague to a hearing, but many employees are not members of a trade union and invariably end up attending a meeting alone. It is vital therefore that you attend properly prepared.
              </p>
              <h2>How can we help you?</h2>
              <p>
                We are able to analyse any evidence against you in detail and provide you with points to put to your employer, which can put you on the front foot in a meeting. We can also provide you with tactical advice throughout the proceedings. We can often provide this service for a fixed fee.
              </p>
              <p>
                Having the right legal advice can really make a big difference to the outcome. We are adept at negotiating settlement agreements and exit strategies when required to do so. If an Employment Tribunal claim is necessary, your chances of success will be increased if the right issues have been raised with your employer.
              </p>
              <h2>Grievance</h2>
              <p>
                If you have a grievance, either relating to the disciplinary matter or otherwise, we are able to assist throughout this process from advising on procedure to drafting your grievance on your behalf and advising you tactically throughout the process. We are also able to analyse your employerâ€™s response and provide you with further submissions to give you the best opportunity to resolve your grievance. We can offer our services in this regard on a fixed fee basis.
              </p>
              <p>
                If, as a result of a disciplinary issue the matter is referred to your professional regulatory body, we will be able to assist you. Please see our Professional discipline and fitness to practise page.
