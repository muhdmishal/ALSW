              <h1>Redundancy Solicitors for Employees</h1>
              <p>
                Redundancy is a situation where your employer terminates your employment due to the fact that work that you carry out has ceased or diminished, or is likely to cease or diminish in the future. If you have worked for your employer continuously for a period of two years, then you will be entitled to a redundancy payment.
              </p>
              <p>
                Your employer must consult with you during the redundancy process and must look at all alternatives to redundancy, such as providing you with a different job or possibly a reduction in salary.
              </p>
              <p>
                Redundancy is a potentially fair reason for dismissal, but, you can challenge the fairness of the decision where your employer has failed to follow the correct procedure, they have used redundancy to hide the actual reason for terminating your contract of employment or where they have incorrectly applied a selection criteria.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the redundancy has resulted due to a business transfer or acquisition, then we will be able to advise you whether the complex rules set up to protect your employment have been followed.
              </p>
              <p>
                If redundancy is inevitable, we can advise you weather the redundancy package, by way of <a href="settlement-agreements.html">settlement agreement</a> or otherwise, you are being offered is fair and can help you negotiate a better deal if it is not.
              </p>
              <p>
