        <h3>How you can help keep your costs down</h3>
        <p>
          We charge for the work we do according to the length of time we spend
          on your matter including telephone calls, emails, preparing documents
          and writing letters.
        </p>
        <p>
          Frequent, lengthy and unnecessary telephone calls or meetings with
          your solicitor will result in further costs to you. Therefore keep
          your calls to a minimum.
        </p>
        <p>
          The clearer your instructions are, the quicker we can prepare your
          applications and statements and the less we will charge you. So,
          before you make a telephone call or come for a consultation, make a
          list of everything you need to let us know.
