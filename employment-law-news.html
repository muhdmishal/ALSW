              <h2>8th April 2014</h2>
              <p>
                Employees will be required from the 6th May 2014 to notify <a href="http://www.acas.org.uk/index.aspx?articleid=1461">Acas</a> (Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service) of a dispute with their employer before issuing a claim to the Employment Tribunal.  The process is optional from 6th April, but mandatory from 6th May 2014.
              </p>
              <p>
                Acas is an organisation which is funded by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, but is governed by an independent Council whose members include unions, academics and leading business personnel. They provide independent, impartial advice to both employers and employees and work with them to try to resolve disputes and improve workplace relations.
              </p>
              <p>
                If the dispute cannot be resolved through the early conciliation process or one of the parties refuses to engage in the process, then an early conciliation certificate will be issued allowing the employee to proceed with an Employment Tribunal claim.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is hoped that the process will further reduce the number of tribunal claims which dropped dramatically following the increase in fees. Some, however, are of the view that it will encourage vexatious or frivolous claims by employees.
              </p>
              <p>
                In relation to changes that will effect employers, from the 6th April 2014 the Tribunal has a discretion to impose financial penalties on an employer, where it is found that there are “aggravating features�?. Although there is no definition of what should constitute “aggravating features�?, it is thought that factors such as the size of the employer, their behaviour and the duration of the breach will influence the exercise of the discretion. Any penalty imposed will be 50% of any award made, up to a maximum of £5,000. There will be a discount if payment is made within 21 days. The tribunal may impose a financial penalty even if no award is made.
              </p>
