              <h1>Medical Negligence Solicitors</h1>
              <p>When we’re ill, we place our trust in doctors, nurses and other medical professionals to help us get better. More often than not, the healthcare we receive is excellent, but sometimes, standards slip and mistakes are made. After all, human errors do happen. For example:</p>
              <p>Your GP may have failed to investigate or diagnose your condition properly.</p>
              <p>Your medical treatment may have been unreasonably delayed, through no fault of your own.</p>
              <p>You may have suffered from disfiguration or scarring as a result of surgery.</p>
              <p>You may even have developed bedsores, MRSA or C Difficile, because of unhygienic and unsanitary conditions in hospital.</p>
              <p>Whatever your circumstances may be, our experienced clinical negligence lawyers at Aletta Shaw can help you. In particular, we’re able to advise you on:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Birth-injury and cerebral palsy claims</li>
                <li>Claims against GPs</li>
                <li>Claims for surgical errors</li>
                <li>Cosmetic surgery claims</li>
                <li>Misdiagnoses</li>
                <li>Incorrect administration of anaesthetics or drugs</li>
                <li>Missed fractures, breaks and spines</li>
                <li>Delays in receiving treatment, or being referred to a specialist</li>

              <h2>Why Choose Us?</h2>
              <p>
                We’ll investigate your case thoroughly, with the assistance of medical experts, if necessary, and we’ll help you claim the compensation you deserve. That could include damages for medical fees, out-of-pocket expenses, pain and suffering, as well as any adaptations and equipment that you might need.
              </p>
              <p>
                What’s more, at Aletta Shaw, we’re renowned for our friendly and personal service. So, we promise we’ll deal with your claim sympathetically, and help you get support for your injury. Indeed, with offices in Bexleyheath and Chislehurst, you’ll never have to travel far to see a solicitor and we may even be able to visit you at home, if you have difficulties attending meetings elsewhere.
              </p>
              <p>
                Of course, we know that you might be worried about the costs of bringing a claim… Don’t be.
              </p>
              <p>
                We’re surprisingly affordable.
              </p>
              <p>
                We may even be able to take your claim on under a ‘no-win, no-fee’ agreement, or through funding from your insurance company. In any event, we’ll try to make sure some of your compensation is paid early to ensure you’re on a firm financial footing for the future.
              </p>
              <p>
